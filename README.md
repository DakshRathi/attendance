# attendance
OVERVIEW
I am trying to develop a website from where teachers and mentor can take online attendance by generating QR Code and participants can scan that QR Code from their phones and thus their attendance gets marked thus saving time of students and teachers.

GOALS
Taking attendance verbally in large classrooms takes a hell lot of time and biometrics can't be installed everywhere due to high cost.
Teachers will generate QR Code by logging in and can share QR Code to students.
Students can scan QR on their phones and thus their attendance gets marked.
Most crucial part of this project is to make website GPS enabled to students within a particular range (about 15-20m ) of host's device (teacher) are able to mark attendance.
